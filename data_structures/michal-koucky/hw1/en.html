<h1>Data Structures I - NTIN066 - Winter Semester 2015/2016 - 1st homework</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Deadline</dt><dd>27th October 2014</dd>
	<dt>How to submit</dt><dd>Submit by email to <strong>ds1@kam.mff.cuni.cz</strong></dd>
	<dt>Input and output</dt><dd>Your solution has to read the data from the file <strong>data.txt</strong> and write the sorted data into the file <strong>data.out</strong>. Assume that the files are in the current directory.</dd>
	<dt>Memory limit</dt><dd>The memory of the test computer is <strong>8 GB</strong></dd>
	<dt>Time limit</dt><dd>Your solution must present the correct result within <strong>60 minutes</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>The rules</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The whole code which you submit must be originally created by you without any "insipiration".</li>
	<li>Do not share your solution so that your code can not become an "inspiration". The only exception is submitting the code.</li>
	<li>The homework and the algorithms may be a subject of conversation. But respect the above rules about non-sharing. That means - dicussing is correct but write the code yourself!</li>
	<li>The solutions which violate the above rules shall be considered as wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The description of the problem</h2>
<p>
Create a program which will sort a file stored on a computer's hard drive. 
Assume that the input file is stored in the current directory and named <tt>data.txt</tt>
The file <tt>data.txt</tt> is a text file. Each row consists of the 64-bit unsigned values - a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>.
In the sorted output file <tt>data.out</tt> the keys are ascending and for each key the minimum value associated with the key is outputted.
</p>

<h3>Testing and generating the data</h3>
Use the unix program <tt>/afs/ms.mff.cuni.cz/u/k/koucky/ds1/2015/hw1/gen-data</tt> available at Rotunda laboratory to generate the input file <tt>data.txt</tt>. Just redirect the standard output to the file <tt>data.txt</tt> since the generator outputs the data to the standard output.
Then measure the running time of your solution using one of the computers from <tt>u-pl0</tt> to <tt>u-pl15</tt>. 

The generated input file <tt>data.txt</tt> is about 48GB large and the time limit for sorting it is 60 minutes. 
The solution which does not finish withing the time limit is considered as incorrect.

When running your program, save the input file <tt>data.txt</tt>, the outputfile <tt>data.out</tt> and the temporary files into <tt>/tmp</tt>. 
After finishing your work delete your files in <tt>/tmp</tt> so that the others can run their programs. 
If you do not delete your files you may consume the whole disk space.
And remember the others can not delete your files and the computer will be blocked.

Also be careful when you see that some else uses the computer. Use commands <tt>who</tt> and <tt>top</tt> or <tt>htop</tt>.
If you see that someone else is performing computations use another computer or wait when he or she is finished. 
Please report any intolerant behaviour to <strong>ds1@kam.mff.cuni.cz</strong>.
The lab administrator can clear <tt>/tmp</tt> directory if necessary.

Submit your solution before the deadline.
The speed and correctness of your solution will be verified on similar data.
Report us the measured running time of your solution along with your solution using the submit for or by email <tt>ds1@kam.mff.cuni.cz</tt> with the following details.

<h2>Generating the test data</h2>
<tt>$/afs/ms.mff.cuni.cz/u/k/koucky/ds1/2015/hw1/gen-data -s XX >/tmp/data.txt</tt>
<p>generates the whole input data.</p>
<tt>$/afs/ms.mff.cuni.cz/u/k/koucky/ds1/hw1/gen-data -s XX --test >/tmp/data.txt</tt>
<p>generates the data for creating your program - only 128 records.</p>
<p>
For generating shorter inputs for testing and debugging you can also use
</p>
<tt>$/afs/ms.mff.cuni.cz/u/k/koucky/ds1/hw1/gen-data -s XX --short >/tmp/data.txt</tt><br />
<tt>$/afs/ms.mff.cuni.cz/u/k/koucky/ds1/hw1/gen-data -s XX --super-short >/tmp/data.txt</tt>

<p>The XX are the two last digits of your student number.</p>
