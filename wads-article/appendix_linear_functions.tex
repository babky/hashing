\section*{Appendix -- proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-linear-refined}}

Although the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-linear-refined} is rather technical we shall enclose it for further possible verification of the results. It may be found in Chapters 5 and 6.3 at \url{http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~babka/hashing/thesis.pdf}. There is one change in the notation, the set of all addresses of the hash table is denoted by $B$ instead of $V$.
