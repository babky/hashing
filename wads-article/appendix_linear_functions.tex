\section*{Appendix -- proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-linear-refined}}
\setcounter{theorem}{1}

\begin{theorem}
Assume universal hashing with the system of all linear transformations between vector spaces over $\bbbz_2$. When storing $n = \bige(m)$ elements, then $$\Expect{\lpsl} \leq 538 \alpha \log n \log \log n + 44,$$ $$\Prob{\lpsl \geq 57.29 \log m \log \log m} < 0.5.$$
\end{theorem}

Although the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-linear-refined} is rather technical we shall enclose it for further possible verification of the results. It may be found in Chapters 5 and 6.3 at \url{http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~babka/hashing/thesis.pdf}. There is one change in the notation, the set of all addresses of the hash table is denoted by $B$ instead of $V$.
