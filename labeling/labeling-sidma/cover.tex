We wish to submit a research article entitled ``On online labeling with large label set'' for consideration by SIDMA. 

We would like to announce that a preliminary version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the 2012 European Symposium on Algorithms. This version of the paper includes the full proofs and also contains an upper bound  for  large  array  sizes in Section 4.

We believe that this version of the paper is suitable for publication in your journal.

Thank you for your consideration. 
We look forward to hearing from you.
