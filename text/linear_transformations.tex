\chapter{The system of linear maps between vector spaces}
Finally we concentrate on the systems of linear transformations between vector spaces over field $\mathbb{Z}_2$. The reason is simple, they allow construction of a model of universal hashing in which expected amortised time of all operations can be guaranteed without any assumptions on the hashed set $S$. 

Main result regarding systems of linear maps is the~upper bound on the~length of the~longest probe sequence. Proofs of this property does not come directly from the~idea showed in the previous chapter. The~approach used does not try to compute the~probability of collision of $k$-elements directly and does not exploit attributes of strongly universal systems. We concentrate and work with special properties of this unique system instead.

In following sections we limit only to vector spaces over the~field~$Z_2$. The shown theorems also suppose hashing $n \log n$ elements into a~hash table of size $n$ slots what is quite novel. The results are used for hashing $n$ elements only and improved for less than $n$ elements. Under these conditions one very important property of this model can be shown; length of the~longest chain is bounded by function in $O(\log n \log \log n)$. If vector spaces used are over other finite fields we can not expect such good properties as shown in \cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/AlonDMPT99}.
