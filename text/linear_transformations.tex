\chapter{The system of linear maps between vector spaces}
Finally we concentrate on the systems of linear transformations between vector spaces over the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$. The reason is simple, they allow construction of a model of universal hashing in which the expected amortised time of all operations can be guaranteed without any assumptions on the hashed set $S$. 

Main result regarding systems of linear maps is the~upper bound on the~length of the~longest probe sequence. Proofs of this property does not come directly from the~idea showed in the previous chapter. The~approach used does not try to compute the~probability of collision of $k$-elements directly and does not exploit attributes of strongly universal systems. We concentrate and work with special properties of this unique system instead.

In the following sections we restrict ourselves only to vector spaces over the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$. The shown theorems also suppose hashing $n \log n$ elements into a~hash table of size $n$ slots which is quite novel. However the results may be used for hashing only $n$ elements they are later improved for hashing such small sets. Under these conditions one very important property of this model can be shown; length of the~longest chain is bounded by a function contained in class $O(\log n \log \log n)$. If vector spaces used are over other finite fields we can not expect such good properties as shown in \cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/AlonDMPT99}.
