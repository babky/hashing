\begin{definition}[$c$-universal class of hash functions]
\label{c_universal_system}
Let $c \in R$ be a positive number and $H$ be a set of functions $h: U \rightarrow A$ such that for each pair of different elements $x, y \in U$, $x \neq y$ we have \[ \left| \lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x) = h(y) \rbrace \right| \leq \frac {c |H|}{|A|} \textit{.} \] The set $H$ is then called $c$-universal class of hash functions.
\end{definition}

At first notice the expected fact that the bound on the number of colliding functions for each domain pair is proportional to the size of the class $H$. More interesting is the inverse proportionality to the size of the hash table. Since the set $A$ can be seen as a hash table. A generalisation of the above definition provides us with an estimate of the number of colliding functions for more than two elements. This count becomes inversely proportional to the power of the table size.

\begin{definition}[Nearly strongly $n$-universal class of hash functions]
\label{nearly_strong_universal_n_system}
Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $c \in \mathbb{R}, c > 1$ and $H$ be a set of functions $h: U \rightarrow A$ such that for every choice of $n$ different elements $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \in U$ and their images $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n \in A$ the following holds \[ \left|\lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x_1) = y_1, h(x_2) = y_2, \dots, h(x_n) = y_n \rbrace \right| \leq \frac{c|H|}{|A|^n} \textit{.} \] Then the system of functions $H$ is called nearly strongly $n$-universal class of hash functions with constant $c$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Strongly $n$-universal class of hash functions]
\label{strong_universal_n_system}
Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $H$ be a set of functions $h: U \rightarrow A$ such that for every choice of $n$ different elements $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \in U$ and their images $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n \in A$ the following holds \[ \left|\lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x_1) = y_1, h(x_2) = y_2, \dots, h(x_n) = y_n \rbrace \right| \leq \frac{|H|}{|A|^n} \textit{.} \] Then the system of functions $H$ is called strongly $n$-universal class of hash functions.
\end{definition}

Every strongly $n$-universal class of hash functions is a nearly strongly $n$-universal class with constant 1.

\begin{definition}[Strongly $\omega$-universal class of hash functions]
\label{strong_universal_omega_system}
Family of functions $H$ is strongly $\omega$-universal if and only if it is strongly $n$-universal for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}

% TODO: Citacia na clanok o systeme omega univerzalnych funkcii.
Such systems provide us with and estimate of the length of the longest chain in the hashing table. This bound can be proved directly from the above property without regarding any other special attributes of a system. So the above property is difficult to be satisfied by a small class of functions. A straightforward example is the set of all function from the domain $U$ to a hash table $A$. As mentioned this system is not very convenient because of its size.

\begin{remark}
Every 2-strongly universal class of hash functions is also 1-universal.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
We need to find the number of functions that make a given pair of elements $x, y \in U$, $x \neq y$ collide. The collision for a function $h \in H$ and given pair can be formally written as $h(x) = h(y)$. The collision may occur for every possible image $t \in A$. Now define the set of functions that display bot $x$ and $y$ on the image $t$ \[ H_t = \lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x) = h(y) = t \rbrace \textit{.} \] These sets are disjoint and moreover $|H_t| = \frac{|H|}{{|A|}^{2}}$. By summing throughout all $t \in A$ we have
\begin{displaymath}
|\lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x) = h(y) \rbrace | \leq \displaystyle \sum_{t \in A} |H_t| = |A| \frac{|H|}{{|A|}^{2}} = \frac{H}{|A|}\textit{.}
\end{displaymath}
The number of colliding functions is then less than $\frac{H}{|A|}$ and the system $H$ is 1-universal.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Every strongly $n$-universal class of functions is strongly $k$-universal for every $1 \leq k \leq n$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
We use an approach similar to one used in the proof of the previous remark. We are given $k$ different elements $x_1, \dots, x_k \in U$ and their images $y_1, \dots, y_k$. We need to find the number of functions that display the element $x_i$ to its image $y_i$. The estimate from the strong $n$-universality is for $n$ elements only. The set of images is extended by $n - k$ elements that are allowed to map on arbitrary bucket, element of the set $A$.

The set of functions mapping given $k$ elements onto their prescribed images, $\bar H$,  may be seen as:
\[
\begin{split}
\bar{H}	& = \lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x_i) = y_i, i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, k \rbrace \rbrace \\
	& = \displaystyle \bigcup_{y_{k+1}, \dots, y_n \in A} \lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x_i) = y_i, i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, n \rbrace \rbrace \textit{.}
\end{split}
\]

Notice that the sets of functions that display elements $x_{k + 1}, \dots, x_n$ onto different images $y_{k + 1}, \dots, y_n$ are disjoint. The sum of their sizes is then equal to $|\bar H|$.
\[
\begin{split}
|\bar H|& = \left| \displaystyle \bigcup_{y_{k+1}, \dots, y_n \in A} \lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x_i) = y_i, i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, n \rbrace \rbrace \right| \\
	& = \displaystyle \sum_{y_{k+1}, \dots, y_n \in A} \left| \lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x_i) = y_i, i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, n \rbrace \rbrace \right| \\
	& \leq \displaystyle \sum_{y_{k+1}, \dots, y_n \in A} \frac{H}{{|A|}^{n}} = {|A|}^{n - k} \frac{H}{{|A|}^{n}} = \frac{H}{{|A|}^{k}}
\end{split}
\]

Now we can see that the class of functions $H$ is strongly $k$-universal, too.
\end{proof}

\section{Examples of universal classes of functions}
In this section we show some examples of common universal classes of hash functions. With each system we provide a simple proof of its universality or strong universality. The systems differ in their domains and codomains. However every presented system can be thought as a mapping from a subset of natural numbers onto another subset of natural numbers.

% Linear systems
\paragraph{Linear system}
System of linear functions was among the first systems of universal hash functions introduced by Carter and Wegman in \cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/CarterW79}. In the article they showed basic properties of universal hashing. Above all they mentioned the expected constant time of the find operation.
\begin{definition}[Linear system]
Let $N$ be a prime and $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Define the sets $U = \{0, \dots, N - 1 \}$ and $A = \{0, \dots, m - 1\}$. Then the class of linear functions 
\[ LS = \{h_{a, b}(x): U \rightarrow A \setdelim a, b \in U \textit{ where } h_{a, b}(x) = ((ax + b) \mod N) \mod m \} \]
is called the linear system.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Linear system is $\frac{\left\lceil \frac{N}{m} \right\rceil ^ 2}{\left(\frac{N}{m}\right) ^ 2}$-universal.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
Consider two different elements $x, y \in U$. We need to compute the number of functions $h_{a, b} \in H$ for which 
\[ (ax + b \mod N) \mod m = (ay + b \mod N) \mod m \textit{.} \]

This is equivalent to the existence of numbers $r, s, t$ that satisfy the following constraints.
\begin{gather*}
r \in \{0, \dots, m - 1 \} \\
t, s \in \left\{ 0, \dots, \left \lceil \frac{N}{m} \right \rceil - 1 \right\} \\
(ax + b) \mod N = s m + r \\
(ay + b) \mod N = t m + r \\
\end{gather*}

Since $N$ is a prime number and $x \neq y$ for every choice of parameters $r, s, t$ there is a solution, parameters $a, b$, that satisfy the equalities.
Number of possible choices of parameters $r, s, t$ is $m \left \lceil \frac{N}{m} \right \rceil ^ 2$. So there are at most $m \left \lceil \frac{N}{m} \right \rceil ^ 2$ functions $h_{a, b}$ that display the given elements $x, y$ to a same value.

Now we need to compute the $c$-universality constant.
\[
m \left \lceil \frac{N}{m} \right \rceil ^ 2 = 
m \left \lceil \frac{N}{m} \right \rceil ^ 2 \frac{\frac{N ^ 2}{m}}{\frac{N ^ 2}{m}} = 
\frac{\left \lceil \frac{N}{m} \right \rceil ^ 2}{\frac{N ^ 2}{m ^ 2}} \frac{N ^ 2}{m}
\]

So the linear system is $\frac{\left \lceil \frac{N}{m} \right \rceil ^ 2}{\left(\frac{N}{m}\right) ^ 2}$-universal.
\end{proof}
% End linear systems

% Linear transformations
\paragraph{System of linear transformations}
\begin{definition}{System of linear transformations}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two vector spaces over $Z_2$ field and moreover $dim(A) = m$ and $dim(B) = n$. System of functions \[ LT = \{L : A \rightarrow B \setdelim L \text{ is a linear transformation}\} \] is called system of linear transformations between $A$ and $B$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
System of linear transformations is $1$-universal.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
Every linear transformation has a matrix $T$ associated with it. We are given two different vectors $x$ and $y$ from the vector space $A$ that are supposed to be displayed on the same image. Let $k$ be a position such that $x_k \neq y_k$. If every element of $T$ except the items in the $k$-th column are given we are able to compute the remaining ones. 

Since the images must be equal for every $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$ the following holds:
\[
\displaystyle\sum_{j = 1}^{m}t_{i, j}x_j = \displaystyle\sum_{j = 1}^{m}t_{i, j}y_j
\]

Then for the element $t_{i, k}$ we have:
\[
t_{i, k} = (x_k - y_k)^{-1}\displaystyle\sum_{j = 1, j \neq k}^{m}t_{i, j}(y_j - x_j)
\]

The elements in the $k$-th column are precisely determined. The number of all functions (matrices) is $2^{mn}$, the size of the target space is $2^n$ and the number of collision ones is $2^{(m-1)n}$. System of linear transformations is then $1$-universal.
\end{proof}
% End linear transformations

% Polynoms
Another system is a generalisation of linear functions to polynomials. The advantage obtained by the system of polynomials is the strong universality exchanged for the size of the system.

\paragraph{Polynomials over finite fields}
\begin{definition}[Polynomials over finite fields]
Let $N$ be a prime number and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Define $U = \{0, \dots, N - 1 \}$ and $A = \{0, \dots, m - 1\}$ The system of functions \[ P_n = \left\lbrace h(x): U \rightarrow A \setdelim h(x) = \left( \left(\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i x^i \right) \mod N \right) \mod m \textit{ for } c_i \in U, 0 \leq i \leq n \right\rbrace \] is then called the system of polynomial hash functions of the $n$-th degree.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Let $N$ be a prime number and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If $A = U$ then the system of polynomial hash functions of the $n$-th degree is strongly $n + 1$-universal. When $A \neq U$ the system is nearly $n + 1$-strongly universal.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
% TODO: Odkaz na Vandermondovu maticu.
Let $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n+1}$ be different elements of $U$ and $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_{n+1}$ are their prescribed images. We can write down system of linear equations that can be used to find the coeficients $c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n$.
\[ 
h(x_i) = y_i, \quad 0 \leq i \leq n 
\]

If $U = A$ the function $h(x)$ is reduced to the form \[ h(x) = \left( \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i x^i \right) \mod N \textit{.} \] Since $N$ is a prime number and the elements $x_i$ are different there is exactly one solution $c_0, \dots, c_n$. The size of the system is ${|U|}^{n+1}$ and $1 = \frac{|U| ^ {n + 1}}{|A|^{n + 1}} = \frac{|U| ^ {n + 1}}{|U|^{n + 1}}$. Now it is clear that the system of polynomial hash functions is strongly $n + 1$-universal.

Let $U \neq A$. We follow the proof of $c$-universality of the linear system. We need to write the equations $h_(x_i) = y_i$ in the field $\mathbb{Z}_N$. Instead using the last modulo operation we introduce new variables $r_i$.

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
\left(\displaystyle \sum_{j=0}^{n} c_j x_{i}^{j} \right) \mod N = {y}_i + {r_i}{m} \qquad 
 & y_i \in \{0, \dots, m - 1 \} \\
 & r_i \in \left\{0, m, 2m, \dots, \left\lceil \frac{N}{m} \right\rceil - 1 \right\} \\
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}
For every choice of $r_i$ we obtain an unique solution of the above equations. The number of all choices of $r_i$ is ${\left\lceil \frac{N}{m} \right\rceil}^{n + 1}$. The count of all hash functions mapping $x_i$ onto $y_i$ complies the following:
\begin{displaymath}
|\{h \in H \setdelim h(x_i) = y_i, i \in \{1, \dots, n + 1\}\}| \leq {\left\lceil \frac{N}{m} \right\rceil}^{n + 1} = \frac{{\left\lceil \frac{N}{m} \right\rceil}^{n + 1}}{(\frac{N}{m})^{n+1}}\left(\frac{N}{m}\right)^{n+1}
\end{displaymath}

This system is nearly strongly $n+1$-universal with the constant $\frac{{\left\lceil \frac{N}{m} \right\rceil}^{n + 1}}{(\frac{N}{m})^{n+1}}$.
\end{proof}
% End polynoms

% Bit string sum
\paragraph{Bit sum of a string over the alphabet \{0, 1\}}
\begin{definition}
Let $p$ be a prime number, $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $A = \{0, \dots, p - 1 \}$ and $l \in \mathbb{N}$, $l \leq p$. S 
\begin{displaymath}
B_{p, l} = \left\{ h: \{0, 1\}^{k + 1} \rightarrow A \setdelim h(x) = \left(\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{k} c_i x_i\right) \mod p, c_i \in \{0, 1, \dots, l - 1\} \right\}
\end{displaymath} 
is called bit string system with parameters $p$ and $l$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Every element $x \in \{0, 1\}^{k + 1}$ can be seen as a $k + 1$-bit number since we can write it in a form $x = x_k x_{k - 1} \dots x_0$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Bit string system for a $k$-ary numbers modulo prime number $p$ and constant $l \in \mathbb{N}$, $l \leq p$ is $\frac{p}{l}$-universal.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
We are given two different elements $x, y$, we estimate the number of all sequences of coefficients $c_0, \dots, c_k$ that satisfy
\[
\left( \displaystyle \sum_{i = 0}^{k} c_i x_i \right) \mod p = \left( \displaystyle \sum_{i = 0}^{k} c_i y_i \right) \mod p \textit{.}
\]

Since $x \neq y$ there is and index $j$, $0 \leq j \leq k$ such that $x_j - y_j \neq 0$.

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
\left(\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c_i x_i\right) \mod p & = \left(\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c_i y_i\right) \mod p \\
c_j(x_j - y_j) \mod p & = \left(\displaystyle \sum_{i=0, i \neq j}^{k-1} c_i (x_i - y_i)\right) \mod p \\
c_j & = (x_j - y_j) ^ {-1}\left(\displaystyle \sum_{i=0, i \neq j}^{k-1} c_i (x_i - y_i)\right) \mod p
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}

Last equality holds since $p$ is a prime number and the number $x_j - y_j$ is invertible in the field $\mathbb{Z}_p$. There is one degree of freedom lost when generating a function that makes $x$ and $y$ collide. The number of all functions is $l ^ {k + 1}$ and the size of the table is $p$. For the number of colliding functions can be computed as follows.

\begin{displaymath}
|\{h \in H | h(x) = h(y) \}| = l^{k} = \frac{p}{l}\frac{l^{k + 1}}{p} = \frac{p}{l}\frac{|B_{p, l}|}{|A|}
\end{displaymath}

The bit string system is thus $\frac{p}{l}$-universal.
\end{proof}
% End of bit string sum.

% All functions
\paragraph{System of all functions}
\begin{definition}
Let $U$ and $A$ be sets such that $|A| < |U|$. The family of functions
\[
H = \{h: U \rightarrow A \}
\]
is called the system of all functions between $U$ and $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
System of all functions between sets $U$ and $A$ is strongly $\omega$-universal.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
We are given $n$ different elements $x_1, \dots, x_n$ and their images $y_1, \dots, y_n$. We compute the size of the set $H_n = \lbrace h \in H \setdelim h(x_i) = y_i, i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, n \rbrace \rbrace$.

\begin{displaymath}
|H_n| = {|A|}^{|U| - n} = \frac{{|A|}^{|U|}}{{|A|}^{n}} = \frac{|H|}{|A|^n}
\end{displaymath}

Now note that the system's size is $|H| = {|A|}^{|U|}$ and thus is it strongly $\omega$-universal.
\end{proof}

% TODO: Citation.
The problem when using this system is that store a single function $h \in H$ is highly inconvenient. To store one element one needs $|U| \log |A|$ bits. When using this simple approach we need to encode the values of elements that will never be stored in the hash table with great probability. An alternative is to construct random partial function from the set of all functions from $A$ to $U$. 

These ideas come from the existence of fast an associative memory having expected time of find and insert operations $O(1)$ and random number generator. Whenever we have to store an element we must determine its hash value. At first using the associative memory we find out it already has a hash value associated. If not we use the random number generator to obtain a random element from $A$ and remember the connection, element - hash value, to the associative memory. This sequentially constructs a random mapping from the system of all functions. Since the random number generator used chooses the elements of $A$ uniformly created system is certainly strongly $\omega$-universal. In addition we do not store the hash values for irrelevant elements.

\section{Properties of systems of universal functions}
In this section we sum up some properties of $k$-strongly universal classes of functions. We concentrate on the generalisation of the known properties of the $c$-universal classes to the strongly universal classes.

The first theorems show the results of combinations of two strongly universal systems.
\begin{theorem}
Let $H$ and $I$ be $k$-strongly universal systems both mapping the universe $U$ to the table of size $m$. Then the system of pair functions 
\begin{displaymath}
J = \lbrace f_{(h, i)}:U \times U \rightarrow \lbrace 0, \dots, m - 1 \rbrace \times \lbrace 0, \dots, m - 1 \rbrace | h \in H, i \in I \rbrace
\end{displaymath} 
is also $k$-strongly universal. Result of a pair function $(h, i)$ is $f_{(h, i)}(x) = (h(x), i(x))$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $x_1, \dots, x_k$ be the elements that are supposed to be mapped onto selected buckets $(y_1, z_1), \dots, (y_k, z_k)$. The number of functions mapping both $h(x_1) = y_1, \dots, h(x_k) = y_k$ and $i(x_1) = z_1, \dots, i(x_k) = z_k$ is $\frac{|H|}{m^k}$ or $\frac{|I|}{m^k}$ respectively. So the number of all functions mapping $h(x_1) = (y_1, z_1), \dots, h(x_k) = (y_k, z_k)$ is equal to $\frac{|H||I|}{m^{2k}}$. The size of the table is $m^2$ and hence the constructed system is $k$-strongly universal.
\end{proof}

Combining two universal systems is not only limited to increasing the table's size. From the previous result we obtain a smaller probability of collision by paying the expensive price of the table expansion. When using a single function the same effect can be achieved by squaring the table size.  We could also combine two strongly universal functions and use a suitable operation to merge the given results into a smaller table. The system created remains strongly universal as it is stated in the next theorem.

\begin{theorem}
Let $B$ denote the set of buckets of a hash table of size $m$ thus $|B| = m$. Both $H$ and $I$ are $k$-strongly universal classes of functions over the table $B$. The operation $o: B \times B \rightarrow B$ is given so that for every $c, a \in B$ there is exactly one $b \in B$ such that $o(a, b) = c$. Then the system of functions $F = \lbrace f_{(h, i)} | h \in H, i \in I \rbrace$ where $f_{(h, i)}(x) = o(h(x), i(x))$ is $k$-strongly universal.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The given elements $x_1, \dots, x_k$ are supposed to be mapped onto the prescribed images $y_1, \dots, y_k$. For every $y_i$ there are exactly $m$ pairs $(a_i, b_i)$ such that $o(a_i, b_i) = y_i$. The probability of event $h(x_1) = a_1, \dots, h(x_k) = a_k$ and $i(x_1) = b_1, \dots, i(x_k) = b_k$ is exactly $\frac{1}{m^{2k}}$. The pair for a single value $y_i$ may be chosen arbitrarily for every $1 \le i \le k$. There are $m^k$ pairs that confirm the values $y_i$. Now we see that $P(f(x_i) = y_i, 1 \le i \le k) = \frac{m^k}{m^{2k}} = \frac{1}{m^k}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Combining the results of pair functions created from $k$-strongly universal classes by the operation:
\begin{itemize}
\item $xor$ where the table size is a power of 2
\item $+$, $-$ over an additive group $Z_l$ where $l$ is the table size
\end{itemize}
gives $k$-strongly universal classes of functions.
\end{corollary}

Next step is to discover the dependence of the parameter $k$ of strongly universal classes on their size. This will show us the best possible probability estimate for the collision.
\begin{theorem}
If $H$ is a $k$-strongly universal system of functions. Then the size of the system is bounded by:
\begin{displaymath}
|H| > m^{k - 1} \log_m \left( \frac{N}{km} \right) \textit{.}
\end{displaymath}

The strong universality of every such system of functions $H$ has its upper bound
\begin{displaymath}
k < 1 + \frac{\log |H| - \log \log_m \left( \frac{N}{km} \right)}{\log m} \textit{.}
\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First we will construct the sequence of sets $U_0$, $U_1$, $\dots$, where $U_0 = U$. The set $U_i$ is the greatest subset of $U_{i - 1}$ that collides under the function $h_i \in H$. From the Dirichlet's principle the size of every set $U_i$ may be estimated as $|U_i| \geq \frac{|U_{i - 1}|}{m}$. By using a bounded induction one can obtain $|U_i| \geq \frac{|U|}{m^i}$.

Now let the index $i$ denote the last set $U_i$ such that $|U_i| \geq k$. The functions $h_1, h_2,\dots, h_i$ map at least $k$ elements of the set $U_i$ to a single image. The probability of this event is less or equal to $\frac{1}{m ^ {k - 1}}$. From this argument we know that $i \leq \frac{|H|}{m ^ {k - 1}}$. Since the index $i$ is last with the property $U_i \geq k$ we also have that $\frac{|U|}{m ^ {i + 1}} < k$. 

Putting it all together:
\begin{gather*}
\frac{N}{m^{i + 1}} < k \\
\frac{N}{k} < m ^ {i + 1} \\
\frac{\log \left( \frac{N}{km} \right)}{\log m} < i \\
\log_m \left( \frac{N}{km} \right) < i \\
\end{gather*}

Obtaining the bound on the size of system of functions:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
\frac{|H|}{m^{k - 1}} & \geq i > \log_m \left( \frac{N}{km} \right) \\
|H| & > m^{k - 1} \log_m \left( \frac{N}{km} \right) \\
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}

This can be rewritten to get bound on $k$ as:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
m^{k - 1} & < \frac{|H|}{\log_m \left( \frac{N}{km} \right)} \\
k & < 1 + \frac{\log |H| - \log \log_m \left( \frac{N}{km} \right)}{\log m} \\
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}
\end{proof}
